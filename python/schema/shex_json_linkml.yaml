    description: >-
      A collection of GO domain/range constraint shapes.  This is primarily used in this schema to allow several 
      test data objects to be submitted in a single file. 

slots:

  object:
    multivalued: true
    range: uriorcurie
    required: true
    description: >-
      The range of the relationship identified by the Relationship.id parameter
      (This contains the values can be provided in the object of a statement)

  id:
    range: string
    description: >-
      The relationship id is the predicate of the relationship between the domain and 
      range of the GO shape expression rule.

  predicate:
    range: string
    description: >-
      The predicate is the relationship between the domain and 
      range of the GO shape expression rule.

  subject:
    range: uriorcurie
    required: true
    description: >-
      The domain of the GO shape expression rule, this is the subject of the relationship.

  root_subject:
    range: uriorcurie
    required: true
    description: >-
      The domain of the GO shape expression rule, this is the root subject of the relationship.


  is_multivalued:
    range: boolean
    required: true
    description: >-
      for this shape, the relationship in question supports multiple values in the object of the association.

    description: >-
      A collection of GO domain/range constraint shapes where a GO domain/range constraint shape 
      is defined as the domain, relationship, and range of a GO shape expression rule.

    required: true

  context:
    range: string
    description: >-
      used to determine if this shape is used in the the visual pathway editor or the graphical editor.  Those shapes
      annotated with like this https://github.com/geneontology/go-shapes/pull/285/files will be excluded from the
      visual pathway editor but still included in the file so this file can be used in the graphical editor as well.
    required: true

  exclude_from_extensions:
    range: boolean
    description: >-
