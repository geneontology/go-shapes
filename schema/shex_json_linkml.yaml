            This is the name of the rule, from the shex rules in JSON format, this can be a GO identifier. 

  Relationship:
    description: >-
      A relationship object holds the relationship (Relationship.id) between a GoShape.domain (subject) and the Relatioship.range (object), 
      the range of the relationship (what values can be provided in the object of a statement), whether or not the 
      object can be multivalued, if the object is required when used with a particular domain and what context the 
      relationship should be used for.

      used to determine if this shape is used in the the visual pathway editor or the graphical editor.  Those shapes
      annotated with like this https://github.com/geneontology/go-shapes/pull/285/files will be exlcuded from the
      visual pathway editor but still included in the file so this file can be used in the graphical editor as well.
